# Machine Learning Burning Man Events Data

- Original Burning Man events EDA and type classification performed with data from 2015-2017 collected by Justin Klein
- But... this preprocessed data only existed for the years 2015-2017
- Data is available online further back to 2009, but is inaccessible through the Burning Man API
- So, I scraped and cleaned Burning Man Festival events data from playaevents.burningman.org using BeautifulSoup3
- On this much larger dataset, I was able to glean additional insights from the EDA about long-term trends
- And the additional data made training and testing the classifier performance more effective
